The notebook contains our final work of the UBC Ovarian Cancer Classification project. 

We split the train data into train and test and stored them in separate folders.

Each of the folder have subfolders which have images corresponding to a class,  
train_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/cs_640/UBC-OCEAN_CS640/final_train_imgs/train' contains subfolders CC, EC, HGSC, LGSC, MC
test_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/cs_640/UBC-OCEAN_CS640/final_train_imgs/test' contains subfolders CC, EC, HGSC, LGSC, MC

We then performed preprocessing on the images using Pytorch's trasnforms method, resizing and normalizing the images.

We conducted various experiments by trying out different pretrained architectures with tuning the hyperparameters for each of them.

Our best model was the EfficientNet_B3 architecture which gave an accuracy of 53% on the validation set.
